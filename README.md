According to wiki, a Simplex (plural: simplexes or simplices) is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions. 
Similarly , this Simplex program gives the output as the number of sides are entered example 2 is a triangle , 3 is a tetrahedron , 1 as line segment 
and so on.
In this program I am validating for the input check, example if user enters and Alphabet then it throws an exception saying "Invalid Number". 
And Also the code is making use of Big Decimal as after the input 64, the long data type overflows. Hence BigDecimal usage is required.
